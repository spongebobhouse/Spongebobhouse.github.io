<pre style="color:blue;> 
  cats are objectively better, theyre tamed carnivores that are adorable.
  but we're not the ones who tamed them. they did that by themselves once
  they knew that we humans will give them anything really. they come in many
  shapes and sizes. i'm convinced the kittens are not even cats, 
  theyre glorified "cat"terpillars, i know those things are just
  pretending to be one. they got a hidden place somewhere to metamorphosized
  into fully grown cats. </pre>
